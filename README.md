<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

![Task Board(Modal) - Dark Mode](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SBagaria2710/task-board/master/public/assets/images/taskboard-modal-dark.png)

A [Kanban](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanban_board)-inspired app for keeping track of things that need to get done.

The goal of TaskBoard is to provide a simple and clean interface to a functional and minimal application for keeping track of tasks. It's not trying to be the next Trello or LeanKit.

What TaskBoard does is make it easy to start keeping track of anything you need to get done. The visual aspect of a board allows for easy status checks, and can be motivating for users who want to move their tasks to the next column.

Here's why:
* Increased productivity and efficiency.
* Focus on continuous delivery.
* Visual status of the ongoing tasks.

Lastly, this is not going to be a throwaway project. I plan to work on more features like integrating [DraftJS](https://draftjs.org/), [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/) app for desktop, group drag and drop, PWA, etc.

### Built With

I learned about a lot of things while working on this [project](https://github.com/SBagaria2710/task-board) and used some new libraries and frameworks. Some of them being:
* [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/)
* [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/)
* [React-beautiful-dnd](https://github.com/atlassian/react-beautiful-dnd#readme)
